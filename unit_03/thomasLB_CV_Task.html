      <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
      <p>The majority of my best work was done as coursework for the International Baccalaureate diploma. If I were to order my favourite bits of work I have done it would look like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>My Maths Coursework: <em>"Modelling the trajectory of a shuttlecock and calculating the details of my favourite serve"</em></li>
        <li>My Computer Science coursework in which I created a Java program for a client</li>
        <li>My Extended Essay: History essay on <em>"To what extent was the breaking of the German Enigma Code during WWII due to the efforts of Alan Turing?"</em></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p>I enjoy both playing and watching sports. I like football and badmintom.</p>
      <p>The ratio of my enjoyment of watching badminton to playing badminton looks like this (Blue is watching)</p>
      <progress id="file" value="32" max="100"> 30% </progress>
      <p>i.e. 3:7, I prefer playing than watching.</p>
